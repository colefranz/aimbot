## Development

### SASS

As CSS still has no support for nesting which we feel is a requirement for large applications (which this will one day be) we will be using SASS. [Install Here](http://sass-lang.com/install). See the installation instructions for your OS of choice.

In order to develop using sass, simply open a command line and navigate to `stylesheets/` and run `sass --watch sass:css`.
